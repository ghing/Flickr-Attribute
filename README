This is a jQuery bookmarklet to extract an attribution string and link from a Flickr photo page.

Create a bookmark in your browser wit the following location to use this bookmarklet:

javascript:(function(){var%20head=document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0],script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='http://geoff.terrorware.com/hacks/flickr-attribute/flickr-attribute.js?'%20+%20Math.floor(Math.random()*99999);head.appendChild(script);})();%20void%200

At the time that I wrote this bookmarklet, I was using the the Monochrome Author theme (similar to the Monochrome Pro theme available at http://graphpaperpress.com/themes/monochrome-pro/) by Graph Paper Press.  It requires that you have an image associated with each post, so I frequently grab Creative Commons licensed photos for posts where I didn't take a photo.  I got tired of building the photo attribution string and link back to the photo by hand, so I made the bookmarklet to generate it with one click.

This is my first attempt at writing a bookmarklet and using jQuery.

I make use of the very helpful jQuery Bookmarklet by Brett Barros with modifications by Paul Irish (http://latentmotion.com/how-to-create-a-jquery-bookmarkliet/) as well as the zeroclipboard library for copying the text to the system clipboard. 

There are probably some bugs with this code as well as lots of room for improvement.  In particular, it would be nice to have the z-index of the bar displayed by the widget set so it covers all the FLickr page elements, but I couldn't set a high z-index without messing up the zeroclipboard functionality.
